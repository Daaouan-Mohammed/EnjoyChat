[## Web Socket](WebSocket)

WebSockets enable real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers. 
With a persistent connection, data transmission becomes efficient and instant. 
Widely used in applications requiring instant updates, WebSockets power chat systems, collaboration tools, and live streaming apps. 
Leveraging this protocol creates interactive web experiences, enhancing user engagement and performance.
